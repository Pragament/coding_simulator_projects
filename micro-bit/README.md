The "Getting Started" tutorial provides an 8-step lesson plan ideal for absolute beginners, focusing on the block editor.

- **Step 1**: Drag the "show string" block into "on start" and customize text (e.g., your name) to see it scroll in the simulator.
- **Step 2**: Add "show string" to "on button A pressed" for event-driven text display.
- **Step 3**: Use "show leds" (smiley pattern) on "on button B pressed" to handle multiple inputs.
- **Step 4-5**: Implement a dice with "show number" and "pick random 1 to 6" in "on shake" for gestures and logic.
- **Step 6-7**: Download code via USB to a physical micro:bit and test interactions.
- **Step 8**: Review completion, emphasizing simulation before hardware.

This takes 20-30 minutes and requires no prior coding knowledge.

| Project             | Key Concepts       | Duration |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Name Badge          | Outputs, events    | 20 min   |
| Dice/Shake          | Randomization, gestures | 15 min   |
| Emotion Badge       | Inputs, conditionals | 25 min   |
| Rock-Paper-Scissors | Variables, selection | 40 min   |

## Beginner Sequence
These build foundational skills in order, as seen in "Getting Started" and first lessons.

1. **Outputs**: Display text, numbers, or LED patterns (e.g., "show string" or "show leds" in "on start").
2. **Events**: Trigger actions on inputs like button presses or gestures (e.g., "on button A pressed").
3. **Randomization**: Generate random values (e.g., dice roll with "pick random 1 to 6" on shake).
4. **Iteration (Loops)**: Repeat actions using "repeat" or "forever" blocks for animations or counters.
5. **Variables**: Store and update data (e.g., scores in games like rock-paper-scissors).
6. **Selection (Conditionals)**: Use "if" statements for decisions based on sensors or inputs.
7. **Sensors**: Read accelerometer, compass, or temperature for interactive projects.
